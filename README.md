# BigQuery Data Analysis Project

## Description
This project explores the Austin 311 Service Requests dataset using BigQuery. The analysis includes exploring common service requests, their sources, and trends over time. The visualizations were created using Looker Studio for easy interpretation.

## Tools Used
- **BigQuery**: To query the public Austin 311 dataset.
- **Looker Studio**: To create visualizations based on the queried data.

## Datasets
This project uses the [Austin 311 Service Requests dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=austin_311&t=311_service_requests&page=table).

## Key Insights
- Summary of the most frequent service requests.
- Analysis of complaints by category, source (phone, email, etc.), and their status (open/closed).
- Trend analysis of the most common service issues over time.

## How to Run Queries
1. Create a Google Cloud account (if you don't have one).
2. Open the BigQuery Console.
3. Run the SQL queries in the `/queries` folder in your BigQuery Console.
4. Use Looker Studio to visualize the results.
